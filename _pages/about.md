I am a Schmidt Science Fellow (https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellows/) and a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Global Health Resilience group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/research-departments/global-health-resilience) in Barcelona Spain. 
My current research focus is towards understanding the impact of our dynamic global climate in bacterial respiratory disease.  I am also working on dengue forecasting in South and Southeast Asia. 
I am working towards elucidating climatic and socioeconomic drivers of pneumococcal disease by integrating earth systems information with infectious disease epidemiological and genomic data in Bayesian hierarchical frameworks. 
I completed my PhD at the Wellcome Sanger Institute where she utilized thousands of Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes together with human mobility and other data types to quantify the extent and mechanisms of pneumococcal spread.
I acquired an MSc in Medical Microbiology and a BA in Biology with a minor in neuroscience. I was previously a research associate focused on genetic epidemiology for projects in both the Huntsman Cancer Institute and the University of Utah Department of Dermatology. My MSc dissertation was a bioinformatic analysis of tuberculosis genomic epidemiology and drug resistance. 
In addition to science I am an avid rock climber, runner, skier, and biker. Ultimately, I strive to utilise advances in genomics research to bridge the health disparity gap globally and improve health worldwide.
