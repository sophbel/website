I'm a postdoctoral scientist at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in the Global Health Resilience group. I completed my PhD at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute as part of the University of Cambridge where I investigated the spatiotemporal and long-range transmission dynamics of the opportunistic bacteria *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. I completed an MSc in Medical Microbiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine where my dissertation investigated genomic drivers of drug resistant *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. 

Ultimately, I strive to utilise advances in genomics research and surveillance, paired with epidemiological methods, to bridge the health disparity gap globally and improve health worldwide.
