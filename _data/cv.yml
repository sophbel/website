      # In a first for this conference we provided travel bursaries for individuals from low
      # and middle income countries. I applied for funding from ISPPD and the Gates
      # foundation and received 15,000€ and 50,000$ respectively. I selected early career
      # scientists given set criteria and submission of an abstract. I coordinated visa
      # applications including visa invitation letters and writing pleas upon visa rejections. I
      # organised a travel company to manage flights for all individuals, ensured
      # transportation to and from the venue, and registration. Furthermore, I have written up
      # a full report for the Gates Foundation including recommendations on funders ability
      # to improve LMIC ECRs to attend such conferences given visa restrictions and time
      # lines. including recommendations on funders' ability to improve LMIC ECRs to attend such conferences given visa restrictions and timelines.

      # 2023. This conference was attended by 180 participants and included 6 scientific
      # sessions. We identified the venue, set the registration prices, applied for sponsorship
      # funding, organised travel bursaries, helped to facilitate visas, organised two poster
      # sessions, a gala dinner, a networking excursion. I was responsible for the finances

    location: Wellcome Sanger <br> Institute (UK)
    year: October 2021
    # description: |
      # I proposed and organised a microbial genomics symposium following the deficit of in-person interactions following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
      # The symposium included about 80 scientists from the teams of Professor Trevor Lawley, Professor Nicholas Thomson, and Professor Stephen Bentley at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.
      # It comprised two sessions highlighting the science of early career researchers from March 2020 to October 2021.
      # Additionally, we included team building, team photos, and arranged lunch and coffee breaks throughout.
      # The day was a success in its initiation of new collaborations across teams and promoting in-person scientific interaction, including a reintroduction to giving scientific talks in person in front of an audience.
